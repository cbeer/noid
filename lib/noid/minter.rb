  # Minters come in two varieties: stateful and stateless. A stateless minter --
  # typically used with random rather than sequential templates, since minting
  # in a sequence requires state to know the current position in the sequence --
  # mints random identifiers and **will** mint duplicates eventually, depending
  # upon the size of the identifier space in the provided template.
  #
  # A stateful minter is a minter that has been initialized with parameters
  # reflecting its current state. (A common way to store state between mintings
  # is to call the minter `#dump` method which serializes the necessary parts of
  # minter state to a hash, which may be persisted on disk or in other
  # back-ends.) The parameters that are included are:
  #
  #  * template, a string setting the identifier pattern
  #  * counters, a hash of "buckets" each with a current and max value
  #  * seq, an integer reflecting how far into the sequence the minter is
  #  * rand, a random number generator
  #
  # Minters using random templates use a number of containers, each with a
  # similar number of identifiers to split the identifier space into manageable
  # chunks (or "buckets") and to increase the appearance of randomness in the
  # identifiers.
  #
  # As an example, let's assume a random identifier template that has 100
  # possible values. It might have 10 buckets, each with 10 identifiers that
  # look similar because they have similar numeric values. Every call to `#mint`
  # will use the random number generator stored in the minter's state to select
  # a bucket at random. Stateless minters will select a bucket at random as
  # well.
  #
  # The difference between stateless and stateful minters in this context is
  # that stateful random minters are *replayable* as long as you have persisted
  # the minter's state, which includes a random number generator part of which
  # is its original seed, which may be used over again in the future to replay
  # the sequence of identifiers in this minter
